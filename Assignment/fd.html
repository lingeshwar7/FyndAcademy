            <h3><strong>Discussing Dairy Alternatives</strong></h3>
        </div>
        <div style="display: flex;padding: 10px;">
            <div style="width: 50%;">
                <p>With the scope of life, we can clearly say that we are not baby cows.</p><br>
                <p>Cows produce milk for the same reason that humans do, to feed their babies. A mother produces milk, and that milk was specifically designed for their baby, a human.</p><br>
                <p>However, within 1-3 days after birth, most dairy farms take calves from their moms. Why would they do such a horrible act? You can thus consume milk, cheese, and yogurt. Although the milk was meant for the calf's infant, it is currently being devoured by people.</p><br>
                <p>What transpires to the infant who was yanked from its mother now? Accordingly, female calves frequently suffer the same heinous destiny as their mothers. When they are old enough, they are bred or artificially sexed. After having their children taken away from them, they are used as milk machines until they are unable to produce milk any more, at which point they are killed.</p><br>
                <p>Male calves are abducted, stall-raised for veal while shackled.</p><br>
                <p>When a dairy cow's milk output starts to diminish, the dairy farms can no longer generate any money by keeping the animal alive. As a result, they die often between the ages of 5 and 6. A cow typically lives around 20 years.</p><br>
            </div>
            <div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
            <div style="width: 50%;">
                <p>Did you know that only humans can consume the milk of another species? In fact, drinking human breast milk would be more natural for any adult who is still consuming milk. The idea of drinking cow lactate should make you queasy if that concept does.</p><br>
                <p>Only our species consumes the milk of other creatures. hy do we all consume milk from cows while we wouldn't consume milk from a horse, pig, racoon, or even our own lactating dog or cat? We continue to eat it even after we stop nursing from our moms. Never in a million years would I cross the street into my neighbor's pasture and milk his cows! You would? In my opinion, no.</p><br>
                <p>Dairy is bad news nutritionally everywhere you look. Whole milk has about half of its calories from fat and almost all of its carbs from sugar, all of which are in the form of lactose, which many individuals find difficult to digest. Even worse, the saturated fat in dairy products is just as high as that in beef. Additionally, dairy has no iron or fiber at all. In addition, you could wonder why the FDA won't say whether milk products contain pus if all of the above aren't enough to get you curious. I did say PUS. You are essentially sipping cow pus.</p><br>
                <p>Therefore, you should be aware that purchasing dairy products helps to prevent the slaughter of young calves for food if you oppose it.</p><br>

            <p>Even though vegetarians and vegans may opt to forgo animal products for comparable reasons, for vegans, this decision frequently goes beyond nutrition. In fact, many people believe veganism to be a highly pro-animal rights way of life. Due of this, many vegans refrain from buying garments made of silk, wool, leather, or suede. Additionally, many vegans boycott businesses that do animal testing and exclusively buy cosmetics devoid of animal byproducts. As well as avoiding circuses, zoos, rodeos, horse races, and other events where animals are used for entertainment, those who identify as "ethical vegans" frequently avoid zoos. Finally, a vegan diet is popular among environmentalists due of its benefits in combating climate change and its lower impact on the planet's resources.</p>
